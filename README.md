# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I've created an employee directory with React by breaking the application's UI into separate components to manage component state, and respond to user events. 

Using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when a user loads the page, a table of employees is also rendered on the page. The user is able to sort the table by multiple categories, and filter the users by multiple properties. 

This site is deployed on GitHub Pages using the `Create React App docs` for deployment.


## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.


* **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.

## Submitted for Review

You are required to submit the following:

* the URL to the deployed application

* the URL to the Github repository
