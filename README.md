# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I've created an employee directory with React by breaking the application's UI into separate components to manage component state, and respond to user events. 

Using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when a user loads the page, a table of employees is also rendered on the page. The user is able to sort the table by multiple categories, and filter the users by multiple properties. 

## Deployed

This site is deployed on `GitHub Pages` using the `Create React App docs` for deployment.

GitHbub Page s to deployed applicaton: [Employee Directory](/)

GitHub Repository: [React_EmployeeDirectory](https://github.com/rdevans87/React_EmployeeDirectory)

## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```
## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user is be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
  
  * Codebase pushed to GitHub **NOT** deployed code.
  
  * `gh-pages` branch used to host the deployed application's code.
